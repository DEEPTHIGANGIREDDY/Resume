            Every hospitality business talks about hiring “nice” people. For us, this all-purpose adjective means three clear personality traits: high energy, natural inclination for guest service, and a sharp presence of mind. In an environment where a minor fumble can make or break an experience, it is important that you think on your feet, pay close attention to guest needs and deliver excellent service.

        <p>
            For our kitchen staff, we look for people who are passionate about great food. Our chefs have an ideal blend of respect for tradition and a desire to innovate.
