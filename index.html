            <p ><strong style="color: cadetblue;">Once upon a time</strong>, there was a cold hearted, backstabbing dragon that was
                so mean and ugly. He loved to travel to the human world and snatch little
                kids out of their beds while they were sleeping, and he would drop them
                down his green tortoise throat. Now back in those days all the kids would
                sit in his stomach and cry, <mark>"Let us out, Let us out."</mark> Of course he would not
                let them out, but sometimes a brave little soul would travel the long journey
                till he plopped out the other end.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                <ins>Now there was a little girl named</ins> <strong style="color: cadetblue;">Susie</strong> who had heard about this evil
                dragon, and wanted to see for herself that he was real. So one night she
                crawled under her sister's bed waiting for the dragon to pick her up. The
                dragon came slowly and silently through the city, getting ready to pick up
                his midnight snack. When Susie saw her she was amazed at how ugly he
                was, <del>is mouth was dripping with drool ready to pick a kid.</del> He then picked
                up Susie's sister with Susie hanging on to her back. Right before she was
                going to be dropped in the pot of doom, she jumped swiftly on to the
                dragons head. She felt the slimy texture of the dragon’s skin on her cold
                bare toes, she waited until the dragon was ready to go, and then she
                clenched his smelly ear as tight as she could so that she wouldn't go flying
                off his head. Then she experienced something no one else had ever
                experienced before, she was flying! She felt the cold winter breeze hitting
                her face as they flew over her city." There is my <sub>house</sub> ," she called with her
                tiny sliver of a voice. She then looked behind her seeing how big the
                dragon actually was and how small she was. She looked up at the night sky
                and closed her eyes, drifting into a deep <sup>sleep</sup>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                <mark>Susie woke up to the sound of big feet stomping on a rock.</mark> As she peeked
                her eyes open, afraid of what she was going to see, she saw multiple
                dragons surrounding the dragon that she was standing on. The dragons
                were making strange sounds in dragon language, yelling at the dragon that
                seemed smaller than the rest. Susie looked down at the dragons eyes
                seeing floods of tears streaming down its face, it was crying. <blockquote>
                    She didn't see
                why they were doing this, this dragon was huge to her, but small to them.
                Then she understood, the dragon was lonely. After what felt like hours, the
                little dragon scooted its way out of the circle moving back to its cave. Then
                she saw the most ugly thing she had ever seen: trash, rubbish, mud
                everywhere, and anything you could think of that was disgusting. 
                </blockquote> 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                <strong style="color: cadetblue;">"Mr. Dragon, I think I might know how to help you."</strong> As soon as the
                dragon heard this, his yellow eyes peered up at Susie having the sense of
                sorrow and anger all at once. As soon as his eyes hit hers they had a long
                stare until the dragon picked her up with his creepy long claws and was
                about to drop her in to his mouth, but he had missed his chance because
                Susie had fainted.

            ‘Please save our princess!’

                ‘My pleasure!’</p>
            <p class="chap1">
                One night an ugly ogre captured
            the beautiful princess and locked her up in his tall, dark tower. 
            ‘Help me!’ 
            ‘Roar!’
            The king and queen were very sad. They promised to give a bag of
            gold to the knight that rescued the princess.
            ‘Please save our princess!’ 
            ‘We’ll save the princess!’ 
            All the knights in the land wanted to rescue the princess. They rode to the tower as fast as they
            could. 
            ‘Help me!’ 
            ‘Roar!’ 
            The ugly ogre roared with anger when he saw the knights. His roar was so scary that they rode away
            as fast as they could. 
            One day a friendly dragon was flying over the ogre’s tower when he heard the princess cry for help. <br>
            ‘Help me!’ 
            The dragon flew down to the tower, took a big fiery breath and blew the ogre far away over the
            mountains and into the ocean. 
            ‘Come with me, princess. Don’t be scared!’ 
            ‘Thank you for saving me.’
            ‘My pleasure, princess.’
